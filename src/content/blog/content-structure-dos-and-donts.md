Creating great content isn't just about what you say—it's about how you structure it. A well-structured piece keeps readers engaged from start to finish.

## The Do's

### Do Use Clear Headings

Break your content into scannable sections. Most readers skim before they commit to reading, so make it easy for them to find what they're looking for.

### Do Start with a Hook

Your opening paragraph should grab attention and clearly state what the reader will gain from continuing.

### Do Use Short Paragraphs

Large blocks of text are intimidating. Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum for better readability.

### Do Include Visual Elements

Images, charts, and infographics break up text and help illustrate your points.

## The Don'ts

### Don't Bury the Lead

Get to the point quickly. If your main insight is in paragraph ten, most readers will never see it.

### Don't Overuse Jargon

Write for your audience's level of expertise, but err on the side of clarity.

### Don't Forget the Call to Action

Every piece of content should guide the reader toward a next step.

## Conclusion

Good structure is invisible when done well—readers simply enjoy a smooth, engaging experience. Bad structure creates friction and drives people away. Invest time in organizing your content before you start writing.
