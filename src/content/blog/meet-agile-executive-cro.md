We sat down with Merick den Turkoglu, our Chief Revenue Officer, to discuss the evolving landscape of SaaS management and what it means for businesses today.

## The Evolution of SaaS Management

**Q: How has SaaS management changed over the past few years?**

The biggest shift we've seen is the recognition that SaaS sprawl is a real problem. Companies went from using a handful of applications to hundreds, often without any centralized oversight. Now, organizations are realizing they need visibility and control.

**Q: What challenges do companies face today?**

The main challenges are:
- Shadow IT and unauthorized app usage
- Redundant applications doing the same thing
- Wasted spend on unused licenses
- Security and compliance risks

## Looking Forward

**Q: What trends do you see shaping the future?**

Automation is key. Manual processes simply can't keep up with the pace of change. We're also seeing increased focus on employee experience – making sure people have the tools they need when they need them.

**Q: Any advice for companies just starting their SaaS management journey?**

Start with visibility. You can't manage what you can't see. Get a complete picture of your SaaS landscape first, then prioritize based on risk and opportunity.
