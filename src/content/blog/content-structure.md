Content Structure: The Do's and Dont's of Content Creation is your guide to creating engaging, well-organized content.

## The Do's

### Do Start with an Outline

Plan your content structure before writing:

- Main points
- Supporting details
- Call to action

### Do Use Clear Headings

Break content into scannable sections. Readers often skim before deciding to read in depth.

### Do Include Visual Elements

- Images
- Infographics
- Code blocks
- Pull quotes

### Do Write for Your Audience

Understand who you're writing for and adjust your tone and complexity accordingly.

## The Don'ts

### Don't Write Wall of Text

Long paragraphs are intimidating. Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences max.

### Don't Bury the Lead

Put your main point early. Don't make readers hunt for the key takeaway.

### Don't Forget Mobile Readers

Over 50% of readers are on mobile. Test your content on small screens.

### Don't Skip Editing

First drafts are never final. Edit for:

- Clarity
- Conciseness
- Grammar
- Flow
